# 8-Queens
A Java Program to solve 8 Queens problem

This program is to print one of the solutions of placing 8 queens on a 8*8 chess board so that no queen cancels the other.
Here we use backtracking.
To change the size of the board, just change the "N" value and change the size of the array in every part of the code (Default is 8 as it is an 8*8 Chess board) and then change the 
(8*8)
int board[][] = { { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 }, 
		  { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 }, 
		  { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 }, 
		  { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 },         
	          { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 },
		  { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 },
		  { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 },
		  { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 }};
        
        TO 
        
        (4*4)
        int board[][] = { { 0, 0, 0, 0}, 
			  { 0, 0, 0, 0}, 
			  { 0, 0, 0, 0}, 
			  { 0, 0, 0, 0}};
        
All the changes have to be done in BT.java program file.

Any queries/doubts regarding the program ?
Feel free to ping me up anytime. I will try to resolve it as soon as possible.
